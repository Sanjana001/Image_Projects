Project Name: 
Image Sketcher

Description: 
This project takes two images one whose sketching will has to be done and second which will add some effects in the resultant image. You will also have to specify the location of directory where you want to save your resultant image. The code will resize the image1, add the image2 into resultant image and finally save it in your desired directory with the name "Image.jpg".

Note: Both the jupyter and python files have the same code. You have to mention the locations of images and directory within the code as the command line arguments are not added in the code.
