Project Name: 
Image Sketcher

Description: 
This project takes two images one whose sketching will has to be done and second which will add some effects in the resultant image. You also have to specify the location of directory where you want to save your resultant image.

Note: Both the jupyter and python files have the same code. You have to mention the locations of images and directory within the code as the command line arguments are not added in the code.
